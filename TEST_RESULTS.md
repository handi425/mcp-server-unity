# Unity MCP Server - Test Results

## Test Date: 2025/6/6

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - All TypeScript files compiled without errors

## Test Summary

### 1. Standard MCP Server (stdio transport)
- **Status**: ✅ Passed
- **Integration Tests**: 12/12 passed (100%)
- **Features Tested**:
  - Project setup and information retrieval
  - Script creation and reading
  - Asset management (scenes, materials, shaders)
  - Package management
  - Editor extensions
  - Batch operations
  - Diagnostics tools

### 2. HTTP Server
- **Status**: ✅ Operational
- **Port**: 3000 (default)
- **Endpoints Verified**:
  - `/health` - Health check
  - `/api-docs` - API documentation
  - `/api/project/setup` - Project configuration
  - `/api/project/info` - Project information
  - `/api/ai/analyze` - AI requirements analysis
  - `/api/system/player-controller` - Game system generation
  - `/api/batch` - Batch operations

### 3. AI Features
- **Status**: ✅ Functional
- **Capabilities Tested**:
  - Natural language requirement analysis
  - Project type detection (2D_Platformer correctly identified)
  - Architecture pattern selection (MVC chosen for 2D platformer)
  - Implementation plan generation
  - Game system code generation

### 4. New Services
- **AICore**: ✅ Requirements analysis and planning
- **AIAutomationService**: ✅ Project structure and architecture setup
- **GameSystemService**: ✅ Player controller and system generation

## Performance Metrics
- Build time: < 5 seconds
- HTTP server startup: < 2 seconds
- API response times: < 100ms for most endpoints

## Key Findings

### Successes
1. Smooth migration from stdio to HTTP transport
2. All existing functionality preserved
3. New AI-driven features working as designed
4. Clean separation of concerns between services
5. Comprehensive error handling

### Known Issues
1. Service state is not shared between HTTP requests (each request creates new service instances)
   - Workaround: Project path must be set for each session
2. WebSocket support not yet implemented for real-time features

### Recommendations
1. Consider implementing session management for HTTP server
2. Add authentication for production use
3. Implement WebSocket support for real-time diagnostics
4. Add more comprehensive unit tests for AI features

## Compatibility
- Node.js: 18.x+ ✅
- Unity: 6000.0.47f1 ✅
- Platform: macOS ✅

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining features (intelligent asset management, code quality automation)
2. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
3. Implement session persistence for HTTP server
4. Create comprehensive user documentation

## Conclusion
The Unity MCP Server has been successfully enhanced with HTTP transport and AI-driven development features. All core functionality is working correctly, and the new features provide significant value for Unity developers looking to accelerate their development workflow.
